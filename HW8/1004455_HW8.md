AI WK11 HW:	Victoria Yong 1004455
### Q1. Logistic Problem I
a.) List down the propositional variables (facts).

```
	truckAt(x)
	packageAt(x)
	isCarrying
	isNeighbours(x, y)
```

b.) Specify the operators (actions), including the pre-conditions and post-conditions.

```
	action move(x, y):
		pre: truckAt(x), isNeighbours(x, y)
		add: truckAt(y)
		del: 

	action load(x):
		pre: truckAt(x), packageAt(x), not isCarrying
		add: isCarrying
		del: packageAt(x)

	action unload(x):
		pre: truckAt(x), isCarrying
		add: packageAt(x)
		del: isCarrying
```

c.) Specify the initial state.
	`init_state = {truckAt(a), packageAt(c), not isCarrying}`

d.) List down the goal state/specification.
	`goal_state = {packageAt(b)}`

### Q2. Logistic Problem 2
a.) What is the optimal solution to this problem?

```
	move(a, b)
	move(b, c)
	load(c)
	move(c, b)
	unload(b)
```

b.) Make this a delete-relaxed problem. What are the changes to the original STRIPS
formulation you made?

Remove the delete preconditions for each action.
```
	action move(x, y):
		pre: truckAt(x), isNeighbours(x, y)
		add: truckAt(y)

	action load(x):
		pre: truckAt(x), packageAt(x), not isCarrying
		add: isCarrying

	action unload(x):
		pre: truckAt(x), isCarrying
		add: packageAt(x), not isCarrying
```

c.) Based on this delete-related problem, list down all the facts Fx and actions Ax at
levels x = {0, 1, ...,M}.

```
	F0: truckAt(a), packageAt(c), isCarrying
	A0: move(a, b)

	F1: truckAt(A), truckAt(b), packageAt(c), isCarrying
	A1: move(b, c), move(b, a)

	F2: truckAt(A), truckAt(b), truckAt(c), packageAt(c), isCarrying
	A2: load(c), move(c, b)

	F3:  truckAt(A), truckAt(b), truckAt(c), packageAt(c), isCarrying
	A3:  unload(a), unload(b), unload(c)

	F4: truckAt(A), truckAt(b), truckAt(c), packageAt(a), packageAt(b), packageAt(c), isCarrying

```

### Q3. Logistic Problem 3
a.) What is the optimal solution to this delete-relaxed problem? What is this heuristic
called?

	The heuristic is the h+ heuristic. 
	`optimal_solution = {move(a, b), move(b, c), load(c), unload(b)}`

b.) What is the value of hadd? Explain why.
	
	hadd = 4
	hadd is the sum cost of goal facts. The goal state `packageAt(b)` appears at F4. Hence, 4 actions are required before the goal state is reached.

c.) What is the value of hmax? Explain why.
	
	hmax = 4
	hmax is the longest path of actions.


### Q4. Generic Planning 1
a.) What is the value of h+? Explain why.
	
	h+ = 2
	h+ refers to the cost of an optimal relaxed plan for s.
	Enumerating the facts and actions of the delete-relaxed problem, we get:

```
	F0: {m}
	A0: A

	F1: {m, n, o}
	A1: B, D

	F2: {m, n, o, p}
```
	The goal state first appears at F2. Hence `h+ = 2`.

b.) What is the value of hadd? Explain why.

	`hadd = 0 + 1 + 1 + 2 = 4`
	hadd is the sum of layers which each fact is added to the state.

c.) What is the value of hmax? Explain why.
	
	`hmax = max(0, 1, 1, 2) = 2`
	hmax is the layer the last fact was added to form the goal state.

### Q5. Generic Planning 2
a.) What is the value of h+ (if any)? Explain why.

	h+ = 2
	Enumerating Fx and Ax for the delete-relaxed problem:
```
	F0: {p}
	A0: C

	F1: {m, p}
	A1: A, C

	F2: {m, n, o, p}
```

b.) What is the value of hadd (if any)? Explain why.
	
	`hadd = 0 + 1 + 2 + 2 = 5`

c.) What is the value of hmax (if any)? Explain why.

	`hmax = max(0, 1, 2, 2) = 2`
